We diligently researched more than 15 complexes and narrowed it down to 3. We finally chose Oakmont based on prior reviews, location, and the excellent communication we received by Lacey and Christina throughout our apt selection and leasing process. All that was represented on-line and via email turned out to be not only very truthful but even better than we expected. Oakmont is in a very convenient yet quiet and picturesque location. The buildings and grounds are maintained with obvious pride. We are leasing a 2Br recently renovated apartment with fireplace which fits the three of us and our cat perfectly as we weren’t looking for anything oversized or high-end. We are minutes from the YMCA, grocery stores, daughter’s preschool and dance school as well as a hospital and beautiful scenery. Tigard, Tualtin, Sherwood and Newberg are minutes away. Best of all we can be in the city of Portland within 15-40 mins depending on time of day. Lacey and Christina continue to be warm and welcoming to the Oakmont community. Our 4yr old daughter already considers them her „new house friends”. We arrived to Oakmont from the East Coast in October.

This place is a great home for dogs of all sizes, and has beautiful sceneries tucked away from the busy traffic of 99W. If you are moving to the area, I highly recommend checking it out.

I attached a video showing the 50+ dead lantern flies lying on the floor in the lobby along with the trash and other debris that is very really cleaned up. The lady who answered my complaint explained that they are both short staffed and are having a hard time finding the replacement part to fix the door. This problem has persisted for upwards of five months now with no end in sight. Since the door broke, our apartment has seen a significant uptick in flies and gnats.

I attached a video showing the 50+ dead lantern flies lying on the floor in the lobby along with the trash and other debris that is very really cleaned up. The lady who answered my complaint explained that they are both short staffed and are having a hard time finding the replacement part to fix the door. This problem has persisted for upwards of five months now with no end in sight. Since the door broke, our apartment has seen a significant uptick in flies and gnats.
