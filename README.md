##  Real Estate ML Project

This project focuses on working with real estate data to perform data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to predict property prices and analyze model performance.

###  Project Structure

The main steps covered in this notebook:

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Read real estate data from a CSV file  
   - Handle missing values and incorrect types  
   - Save the cleaned dataset

2. **Data Generation**  
   - Generate a dummy dataset with realistic real estate features  
   - Include classification targets based on number of bedrooms

3. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
   - Encode categorical features (e.g., city, province)  
   - Handle missing values in numeric and text fields  
   - Normalize or scale numeric data

4. **Model Building**  
   - Models used:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - XGBoost
   - Fit and evaluate each model on training/testing sets

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics used:
     - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
     - RÂ² Score
   - Visualizations:
     - Residual plots
     - Bar graphs comparing model performance
