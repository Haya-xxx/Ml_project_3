# Real Estate Price Prediction Project

This project demonstrates a full pipeline for building a predictive model on real estate data, including:

- Generating dummy property data with a classification target
- Creating a FastAPI backend serving the dummy data
- Fetching and cleaning real and dummy data
- Combining datasets and preprocessing features
- Training and evaluating regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Visualizing model residuals for performance diagnostics
